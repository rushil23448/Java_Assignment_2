ArrayArrayListConversionMenu
This Java program offers a menu-driven interface to convert arrays to ArrayLists and vice versa. The menu includes the following options:

Convert Array to ArrayList: Takes comma-separated elements as input for an array and converts it to an ArrayList. Convert ArrayList to Array: Accepts space-separated elements for an ArrayList and converts it to an array. Exit: Terminates the program. The conversion functions showcase the usage of Java's ArrayList and Array utilities.

SmallestDistanceMenu
This Java program provides a menu-driven interface for operations on an array of integers. The menu includes the following options:

Enter an array of numbers: Allows the user to input the size and elements of an array of integers. Find the index of the first number with the smallest distance: Identifies the index of the first number with the smallest absolute distance to its neighbor in the array. Exit: Terminates the program. The program includes functions to input an array and find the index of the number with the smallest distance between neighbors.

EvenOddArray
This Java program prompts the user to input a specified number of integers and categorizes them into two arrays based on their parity (even or odd). The program includes the following features:

Input Size: Accepts the number of elements to be entered. Arrays Declaration: Declares two arrays, one for even numbers and one for odd numbers, both with a size specified by the user. Input and Categorization: Accepts integers from the user and categorizes them into the even or odd array based on their parity. Print Even Array: Displays the elements of the even array. Print Odd Array: Displays the elements of the odd array. Program Termination: Closes the scanner to release resources.
